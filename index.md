# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Erik Hofreiter and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

## CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 was one of my favorites because, mainly, of the people I worked with.
    Getting to that later, I love using "for i" loops, so being able to use them
    in such a simple way was incredibly relaxing and made the projects fun.
    On to the main topic, Justin and Evan were incredibly fun to joke around with
    and actually knew what they were doing. Joking with them, and completing the
    projects on time was a great feeling, and I knew I had fun doing it.

* Lab 10

    You wouldn't believe who I worked with for this lab. In all seriousness
    I get describe how amazing it felt when my partners actually knew the content
    that was being discussed in class and being used in lab. In addition, working 
    with different files and going through them each (again, with for i loops), was
    very challenging and a lot of fun to go around different problems and finally
    get that "Oh!" moment and understand what's going on.

* Lab 05

    Finally working with and defining functions is key for any programmer. Getting
    to that point made me ecstatic. Also, Isaiah also actually knew what he was doing
    and understood the content that was being taught. With that in mind, going through
    the process of creating and using different functions was fun.
