# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Erik Hofreiter and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

## CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 was one of my favorites because, mainly, of the people I worked with.
    Getting to that later, I love using "for i" loops, so being able to use them
    in such a simple way was incredibly relaxing and made the projects fun.
    On to the main topic, Justin and Evan were incredibly fun to joke around with
    and were very easy to work with; they had prior experience coding and it definitely showed. Joking with them, and completing the
    projects on time was a great feeling, and I knew I had fun doing it.

* Lab 10

    You wouldn't believe who I worked with for this lab. In all seriousness
    I get describe how amazing it felt when my partners volunteered to work on the assignment. They understood the content and had prior years of computer science knowledge under their belt. In addition, working 
    with different files and going through them each (again, with for i loops), was
    very challenging and a lot of fun to go around different problems and finally
    get that "Oh!" moment and understand what's going on. I also developed a personal vendetta against for each loops.

* Lab 05

    Finally working with and defining functions is key for any programmer. Getting
    to that point made me ecstatic. Isaiah was a fantastic partner, and was incredibly easy to work with. With that in mind, going through
    the process of creating and using different functions was fun. 

My time in CPSC 120L was very eye opening and fun. The people that I got to work with were incredible and I got along with all of them very well. I look forward to learning more about c++ in 121!
